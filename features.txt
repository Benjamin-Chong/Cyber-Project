Write detailed README.md covering:

Project goals

How to run/use it

Security features explained

Known limitations

✅ 3. Finalize README.md

Your README should have:

Project Goals (what problem it solves, why it matters)

How to Run/Use It (dependencies, run instructions, example usage)

Security Features Explained (encryption, lockout system, safe JSON handling)

Known Limitations (e.g., key stored locally, not production-ready, console-only)

Example Usage (screenshot/code snippet of running it)

✅ 4. Style Polish

Consistency (indentation, variable naming, f vs file like we talked about).

Remove unused imports (e.g., Fernet you don’t need).

Make sure all print() outputs look neat for users (no raw debug unless intentional).

✅ 5. Reflection

Since this is your final day, write a short reflection for yourself:

What you learned (encryption, safe file handling, project structuring).

What you’d improve if you had 1–2 more weeks.
This is great material for resume bullets or interviews.
