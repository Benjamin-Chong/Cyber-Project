# Cybersecurity CLI Project
*A Python CLI exploring authentication, encryption, and password security*  

## üìñ Overview

This project explores core cybersecurity concepts through a Python-based command line interface. It simulates user account management with features such as:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with QR codes and authenticator apps

- Password hashing and verification using bcrypt and SHA-1 breach check

- Data encryption/decryption with Fernet and salt

- Account lockout system after repeated failed logins

The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of security principles while improving logic and coding skills.

## üöÄ Features
- User Management ‚Äì Create, delete, search, and list users

- Authentication ‚Äì Login with password and optional MFA

- Password Security ‚Äì Hashing with bcrypt, breach check using SHA-1 and K-anonymity API

- Encryption ‚Äì Sensitive data encrypted locally with Fernet

- Lockout ‚Äì Temporary lock after multiple failed login attempts
## üîß How To Run/Use:

1. **Install Dependencies:** 
Make sure python is installed and install all of the libraries that are covered in the requirements.txt. Use pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Run the Program:** python cli.py

3. **Example usage:**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations:

- ‚ùå Does not support undoing actions (Ctrl + C required)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MFA enable/disable does not require password
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Key stored locally
- ‚ùå Not production ready
- Console only

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Python
- bcrypt - password hashing
- cryptography(Fernet) - encryption/decryption
- requests - API calls for password breach checking

## üìù Reflection  
This project strengthened my understanding of core cybersecurity practices and improved my Python skills.  
I explored authentication, hashing, and encryption concepts that gave me a clearer idea of whether I‚Äôd like to pursue cybersecurity further.
